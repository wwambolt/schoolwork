implementations, and gives an introduction to big O analysis.
By the end of the course you will have mastered the following programming and general concepts:
    1. Abstractions
    2. Specifications
    3. Modularity and data hiding
    4. Implementation and applications of Abstract Data Types (ADTs)
    5. Introduction to algorithm analysis
