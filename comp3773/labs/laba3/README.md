Lab 3

Implement a class setOper, then provides several simple set operations. The class only needs to deal with sets that are closed intervals specified by two real numbers; for example, the pair( 2.5, 4.5) represents the interval [2.5, 4.5]. The following operations should be supported:

 Check if the value x belongs to the given interval.

 Check if the value x belongs to the intersection of two intervals.  

Check if the value x belongs to the union of two intervals.

 test this class  in the main program.

Hand in a zip file containing:

•header and implementation files for the setOper class

•the main program source code.
