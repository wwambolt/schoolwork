Lab Assignment 5

Extend the AnimalWorld application (I will send it to you in email) with an AustraliaFactory class. The Herbivore for this continent is the Rabbit, and the Carnivore is the Dingo. Revise the getContinent method from ContinentFactory so that the name Australia returns a new AustraliaFactory object. Test your code by editing the AnimalWorld-Config.txt file and running the unchanged AnimalWorld program.

Submit a tar archive containing:

•ContinentFactory.cpp (as revised) •AnimalWorld-Config.txt (as revised) •your new files (AustraliaFactory.h, AustraliaFactory.cpp, Rabbit.h, Rabbit.cpp, Dingo.h, Dingo.cpp) Please use the correct capitalization for file names!
