Assignment 1
Complete exercises 2-7, 2-9 on page 60 and 3-2 on page 129 from the text.

2-7 Write a recursive function double power(double x, int n)     that implements the following algorithm to compute x!n. For even values of n, compute x!(n/2) * x!(n/2)     for odd values of n, compute x * x!(n/2) * X!(n/2)     Test this program in the main program.   please notice that ! means Power.

2-9 Write a function that returns the average of all the values stored in an interge array arr of size n; the return type of function should be double. Test this function in the main program.

3-2 Implement a class Fractions, that represents fractions. This class should provide a constructor and four functions to add, subtract, multiply, and divide fractions. Fractions should always be reduced to lowest terms. Test this class in the main program.

***************

Create and submit a tar archive containing the following files:

•a1-2-7.cpp •a1-2-7-script.txt •a1-2-9.cpp •a1-2-9-script.txt •Fraction.h •Fraction.cpp •a1-Fraction-script.txt

Name your tar file with your student number followed by "-a1".  For example, 100000666-a1.tar.

Each .cpp file contains a main function that uses hard-coded values ("magic numbers" are OK here) and user input to test each function.  Make sure the hard-coded values include a good spread of test cases, and use a loop to allow the user to give multiple tests of the function(s) as well. (For the fraction testing, read in four integers to form two fractions, and show the result for each method for each pair.)
