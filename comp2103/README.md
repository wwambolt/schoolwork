# COMP 2103

## Course Outline
    -This course shall provide students with a good working knowledge of the following topics:
        • the C programming language, emphasizing procedural programming techniques and
            portability;
        • the Linux operating system, emphasizing tools and utilities for efficient and effective
            programming, as well as the C programming interface with Linux;
        • the development of correct and robust software, and the importance of thorough
            testing to meet these goals; and
        • the use of the shell as both a command interpreter and a scripting language.
    -Linux is very similar to other UnixTM variants (such as Sun’s Solaris, Silicon Graphics’
        Irix, FreeBSD, and so on); upon successful completion of this course students should be
        capable of productive work in any UnixTM environment.
